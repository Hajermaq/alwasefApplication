# alwasef_app Graduation Project

Al-Wasef is an e-prescribing system that will develop the prototype of a mobile application to enhance the functionality of the archaic paper-based system. 
The main purpose of this application is to serve a certain hospital with its healthcare providers and as well as its patients. To provide more accurate and well-prescribed medications for patients, the application is tracking all medication data history written by doctors to prevent medication mistakes.

 We Applied Dart as programming language and Flutter as a Framework. 
 We also managed a working customer database with Firebase NoSQL database.
